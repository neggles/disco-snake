# ailogger

this is a modified version of [@aweber/json-scribe](https://github.com/aweber/json-scribe) that I have repurposed to log AI model prompts, outputs, and other parameters to disk in [jsonl](https://jsonlines.org/) format

both the original code and my modifications are covered under the BSD 3-clause license, see [./LICENSE](the local license file)
