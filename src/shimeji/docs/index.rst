=======

Shimeji is a Python library that provides functions for
building dynamic and open domain chatbots.

**Features:**

- **Open domain**: Chatbots developed with this library can respond to
  any input.

  easily integrated with any API.

Here is an example conversation produced with the framework:

    User: Hello
    Bot: Hello.
    User: How are you?
    Bot: I'm fine.
    User: Have you been up to anything lately?
    Bot: I haven't been doing anything.
