# disco snake

a discord bot built using [disnake](https://disnake.dev) and a bunch of other crap.

uses text-generation-webui, stable-diffusion-webui, and a couple misc custom scripts as a backend

also postgres

this is a low-effort readme.

## but what does it do

It started as a dumb chatbot and it is still a dumb chatbot. I am *recklessly* abusing GPT-Neo XL
to generate responses in a conversational context, which it is in no way designed for, so predictably
the output it generates is.... let's say Interesting ;)

It also runs a couple of Diffusers models and such to do fun image generation things.

## Installation

honestly just don't, this code is a mess
