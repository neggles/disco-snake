# disco snake

a discord bot built using [disnake](https://disnake.dev), [aitextgen](https://docs.aitextgen.io/)
(for the time being), [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co) Transformers, and Huggingface Diffusers.

## but what does it do

It started as a dumb chatbot and it is still a dumb chatbot. I am *recklessly* abusing GPT-Neo XL
to generate responses in a conversational context, which it is in no way designed for, so predictably
the output it generates is.... let's say Interesting ;)

It also runs a couple of Diffusers models and such to do fun image generation things.

## Installation

honestly just don't, this code is a mess
